  <p>A React project template configured for TypeScript development and bundled with Webpack.</p>

  [React](https://reactjs.org/) | [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) | [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
</div>

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start

Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed. Version 10.13.0 (LTS) or higher is required.

> **Recommended**: Use a Node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

Dependency installation is managed via `npm`. Once cloned, you can install dependencies from the project root:

```shell
npm install
```

Once dependencies are installed, you can run the React local development server on port `8080`:

```shell
npm start
```

To test components, you can run all Jest suites:

```shell
npm test
```

And boom! You're ready to create a new React application with TypeScript! üéâ

## üôãüèΩ Why?

While [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) is a great way to jump start a simple project, it unfortunately abstracts away most of the configuration. This makes it difficult to understand React project configuration for quick customization or required packages for dependency management.

## üß± How?

This React template was created from scratch using the bare minimum package dependencies needed to run a React + TypeScript project that is bundled with Webpack and tested with Jest.

Review the [pull request history](https://github.com/cloud-city-crafted/react-typescript-webpack-template/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Acreated-asc) to see which files were created/edited for each step of the configuration process.

1. [Initialize Project](https://github.com/cloud-city-crafted/react-typescript-webpack-template/pull/1)
2. [Setup TypeScript](https://github.com/cloud-city-crafted/react-typescript-webpack-template/pull/2)
3. [Setup React](https://github.com/cloud-city-crafted/react-typescript-webpack-template/pull/3)
4. [Setup Jest](https://github.com/cloud-city-crafted/react-typescript-webpack-template/pull/4)
5. [Setup Webpack](https://github.com/cloud-city-crafted/react-typescript-webpack-template/pull/5)
6. (Optional) [Setup Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/cloud-city-crafted/react-typescript-webpack-template/pull/6)

You can also find more detailed steps in the [How to Setup a React App with TypeScript + Webpack from Scratch](https://dev.to/thelandolorien/how-to-setup-a-react-app-with-typescript-webpack-from-scratch-19cd) post on [DEV](https://dev.to/).

## ‚öõÔ∏è What?

This project template only uses the dependencies and configurations needed to:

- Create a React Web Application
- Develop React Components using TypeScript (using `.tsx` files)
- Test React Components using Jest
- Bundle a React Web Application for Production
- Serve a React Web Application locally with automatic reloads on save
- (Optional) Build custom design systems using Tailwind CSS utility classes

The final state is a React app equivalent to the starting point of [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).
